# How to merge vanilla and reference worlds.
#   - SURFACE: Generation will be based on the custom word surface. It have a top limits with surface_and_absolute.limit and always generate world at least x blocks below the custom world surface (see relative_and_surface.depth). This is the best choice for most cases.
#   - RELATIVE: At a given depth based on terrain height and air pockets at every X and Z coordinates. This strategy sometimes results in stone clusters at random places. Use only if you absolutely need to keep your custom world underground caves.

#   - ABSOLUTE: At a fixed Y height.
#   - NONE: Just... don't merge. Reference world will be re-generated without vanilla underground.
